*This page documents the PerfettoSQL standard library.*

## Introduction

The PerfettoSQL standard library is a repository of tables, views, functions
and macros, contributed by domain experts, which make querying traces easier.
Its design is heavily inspired by standard libraries in languages like Python,
C++ and Java.

Some of the purposes of the standard library include:

1. Acting as a way of sharing and commonly written queries without needing to copy/paste large amounts of SQL.
2. Raising the abstraction level when exposing data in the trace. Many modules in the standard library convert low-level trace concepts e.g. slices, tracks and into concepts developers may be more familar with e.g. for Android developers: app startups, binder transactions etc.

Standard library modules can be included as follows:

\`-- Include all tables/views/functions from the android.startup.startups
-- module in the standard library.
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;

-- Use the android_startups table defined in the android.startup.startups
-- module.
SELECT \*
FROM android_startups;\`Prelude is a special module is automatically included. It contains key helper
tables, views and functions which are universally useful.

More information on importing modules is available in the
[syntax documentation](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/perfetto-sql-syntax#including-perfettosql-modules)
for the `INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE` statement.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | ID | Unique identifier for this track. Identical to |
| name | STRING | Name of the track; can be null for some types of tracks (e.g. thread tracks). |
| type | STRING | The type of a track indicates the type of data the track contains. Every track is uniquely identified by the the combination of the type and a set of dimensions: type allow identifying a set of tracks with the same type of data within the whole universe of tracks while dimensions allow distinguishing between different tracks in that set. |
| dimension_arg_set_id | ARGSETID | The dimensions of the track which uniquely identify the track within a given `type`. Join with the `args` table or use the `EXTRACT_ARG` helper function to expand the args. |

Possible values: \* 'REAL' \* 'SYNTHETIC_WITH_EXTRAPOLATED_INPUT_GENERATION_TIMESTAMP' \* 'SYNTHETIC_WITHOUT_EXTRAPOLATED_INPUT_GENERATION_TIMESTAMP' The first scroll update is decided as follows: \* For real scroll updates, we consider their actual input generation timestamp. \* For synthetic scroll updates, we extrapolate their input generation timestamp based on the input generation → begin frame duration of the most recent real scroll update UNLESS ANY of the following holds (in which case we DON'T extrapolate input generation timestamps for synthetic scroll updates in this frame): \* This frame is janky. \* All frames since the beginning of the scroll up to and including the previous frame have contained only synthetic scroll updates. \* The most recent janky frame contained only synthetic scroll updates and all frames since then up to and including the previous frame have contained only synthetic scroll updates. If, based on the above rules, the scroll update with the earliest input generation timestamp is a real scroll update, then this frame's type is 'REAL'. If the scroll update with the earliest input generation timestamp is a synthetic scroll update, then this frame's type is 'SYNTHETIC_WITH_EXTRAPOLATED_INPUT_GENERATION_TIMESTAMP'.

All frames between (both ends exclusive): a. the last frame presented by Chrome before F and b. F are non-damaging. If this frame is damaging, its type is 'DAMAGING'. If this frame is non-damaging and its presentation timestamp could be extrapolated based on the begin frame → presentation duration of the most recent damaging frame, its type is 'NON_DAMAGING_WITH_EXTRAPOLATED_PRESENTATION_TIMESTAMP'. If this frame is non-damaging and its presentation timestamp couldn't be extrapolated for ANY of the reasons below, its type is 'NON_DAMAGING_WITHOUT_EXTRAPOLATED_PRESENTATION_TIMESTAMP': \* This frame is janky and non-damaging. \* All frames since the beginning of the scroll up to and including this frame have been non-damaging. \* The most recent janky frame was non-damaging and all frames since then up to and including the this frame have been non-damaging. Note: The `first_scroll_update_type` and `damage_type` columns are orthogonal. The former depends on whether the frame is synthetic (only contains synthetic scroll updates). The latter depends on whether the frame is damaging. For example: \* If a frame is synthetic and damaging, it will\[1\] have an extrapolated input generation timestamp. \* If a frame is real and non-damaging, it will\[1\] have an extrapolated presentation timestamp. \* If a frame is both synthetic and damaging, it will\[1\] have both timestamps extrapolated. \[1\] As long as there's Chrome past performance to extrapolate based on. |

**chrome_speedometer_2_1_measure**

TABLE
Augmented slices for Speedometer measurements.
These are the intervals of time Speedometer uses to compute the final score.
There are two intervals that are measured for every test: sync and async
sync is the time between the start and sync-end marks, async is the time
between the sync-end and async-end marks.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ts | TIMESTAMP | Start timestamp of the measure slice |
| dur | DURATION | Duration of the measure slice |
| name | STRING | Full measure name |

**chrome_speedometer_2_1_iteration**

TABLE
Slice that covers one Speedometer iteration.
This slice is actually estimated as a default Speedometer run will not emit
marks to cover this interval. The metrics associated are the same ones
Speedometer would output, but note we use ns precision (Speedometer uses
\~100us) so the actual values might differ a bit. Also note Speedometer
returns the values in ms these here and in ns.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ts | TIMESTAMP | Start timestamp of the iteration |
| dur | DURATION | Duration of the iteration |

If the trace doesnt contain the VSync TraceEvent we just fall back on
assuming its 60 FPS (this is the 1.6e+7 in the COALESCE which
corresponds to 16 ms or 60 FPS).
Returns DOUBLE: The average vsync interval on this time segment or 1.6e+7, if trace doesn't contain the VSync TraceEvent.

**android_battery_stats_event_slices**

VIEW
View of slices derived from battery_stats events. Battery stats records all
events as instants, however some may indicate whether something started or

apps or long wakes include these details and allow drawing slices between
instant events found in a trace.

For example, we may see an event like the following on 'battery_stats.top':

`-top=10215:"com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher"` This view will find the associated start ('+top') with the matching suffix
(everything after the '=') to construct a slice. It computes the timestamp
and duration from the events and extract the details as follows:

`track_name='battery_stats.top'
str_value='com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher'
int_value=10215`

### android.job_scheduler

#### Views/Tables

**android_job_scheduler_events**

TABLE
All scheduled jobs and their latencies.

The table is populated by ATrace using the system server ATrace category
(`atrace_categories: "ss"`). You can also set the `atrace_apps` of interest.

This differs from the `android_job_scheduler_states` table
in the `android.job_scheduler_states` module which is populated
by the `ScheduledJobStateChanged` atom.

Using `android_job_scheduler_states` is preferred when the
`ATOM_SCHEDULED_JOB_STATE_CHANGED` is available in the trace since
it includes the constraint, screen, or charging state changes for
each job in a trace.

**android_job_scheduler_with_screen_charging_states**

TABLE
This table returns the constraint, charging,
and screen state changes that a job will go through
in a single trace.

Values from this table are derived from
the `ScheduledJobStateChanged` atom. This differs from the
`android_job_scheduler_events` table in the `android.job_scheduler` module

#### Macros

**android_network_uptime_spans**

Computes network uptime spans based on an idle timeout model.

It is common in networking to have an interface active for some time after
use. For example, mobile networks are often connected for 10 or more seconds
after the last packet is sent or received. This macro simulates this timeout
and returns spans that approximate the underlying connected regions.
Returns: TableOrSubquery,

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| src | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery containing the network events to apply the idle timeout model to. The table must contain all partition_columns, ts, dur, packet_count, and packet_length. |
| partition_columns | ColumnNameList | A parenthesized set of columns to partition the analysis by. |
| timeout | Expr | The idle timeout, expressed in nanoseconds. |

**android_network_uptime_cost**

Compute the per-row uptime cost of network activity.

It is common in networking to have an interface active for some time after
use. For example, mobile networks are often connected for 10 or more seconds
after the last packet is sent or received. This macro computes a cost factor
indicating how much each row impacts the idle timer.

For example, assuming a 10s timeout, the first packet will extend the timeout
10s in the future, and be assigned 10s of cost. If a packet arrives 4s later,
it pushes the timer an additional 4s, receiving 4s of cost. In this simple
case, cost is MIN(ts-last_packet_ts, timeout).

The complication is that network events can be aggregates, with more than one
packet. In such cases, we end up with a span with non-zero duration, rather
than an instant, and no easy way to compute time since the last packet.

The solution is to detect overlap regions and compute cost for the region as
a whole. The first event in each group receives the standard uptime cost as
described above. Each group has an additional cost equal to the duration of
the group which is distributed using packet count as weight.

For example (times in seconds, no partition, and 10 second timeout):

`ts=5, dur=0, packet_count=1 -> group=1, uptime_cost=10
ts=7, dur=0, packet_count=1 -> group=2, uptime_cost=2
ts=20, dur=5, packet_count=9 -> group=3, uptime_cost=14.5
ts=22, dur=0, packet_count=1 -> group=3, uptime_cost=0.5` The third group spans ts=20 to ts=25, with a timeout at ts=35. This gives the
group a total cost of 15 which is distributed between the two rows. The 3rd
row receives 10s for being first, and 9/10 the duration cost (5\*9/10=4.5).

The returned table schema is (id ID, uptime_cost INT64) where uptime cost is
in nanoseconds.
Returns: TableOrSubquery,

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| src | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery containing the network events to apply the idle timeout model to. The table must contain all partition_columns, id, ts, dur, and packet_count. |
| partition_columns | ColumnNameList | A parenthesized set of columns to partition the analysis by. |

Standardizes an Android thread name by extracting its core identifier to make it
possible to aggregate by name.

Removes extra parts of a thread name, like identifiers, leaving only the main prefix.
Splits the name at ('-', '\[', ':' , ' ').

Some Examples:
Given thread_name = "RenderThread-1\[123\]",
returns "RenderThread".

Given thread_name = "binder:5543_E"
returns "binder".

Given thread_name = "pool-3-thread-5",
returns "pool".

Given thread_name = "MainThread",
returns "MainThread".
Returns STRING: Simplified name

## Package: intervals

### intervals.intersect

#### Macros

**interval_self_intersect**

Given a list of intervals (ts, dur), this macro generates a list of interval
end points as well as the intervals that intersect with those points.

e.g. input (10, 20), (20, 25)

`10 30
A |---|
B|---|
20 45` would generate the output:

`ts,dur,group_id,id,interval_ends_at_ts
10,10,1,A,0
20,10,2,A,0
20,10,2,B,0
30,15,3,A,1
30,15,3,B,0
45,0,4,B,1` Runtime is O(n log n + m), where n is the number of intervals and m
is the size of the output.
Returns: TableOrSubquery,

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| intervals | TableOrSubquery | Table or subquery containing interval data. |

### intervals.overlap

#### Macros

**intervals_overlap_count**

Compute the distribution of the overlap of the given intervals over time.

Each interval is a (ts, dur) pair and the overlap represented as a (ts, value)
counter, with the value corresponding to the number of intervals that overlap
the given timestamp and interval until the next timestamp.
Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (ts TIMESTAMP, value LONG). \|ts\| is the timestamp when the number of open segments changed. \|value\| is the number of open segments.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| segments | TableOrSubquery | Table or subquery containing interval data. |
| ts_column | ColumnName | Column containing interval starts (usually `ts`). |
| dur_column | ColumnName | Column containing interval durations (usually `dur`). |

**intervals_overlap_count_by_group**

Compute the distribution of the overlap of the given intervals over time from
slices in a same group.

Each interval is a (ts, dur, group) triple and the overlap represented as a
(ts, value, group) counter, with the value corresponding to the number of
intervals that belong to the same group and overlap the given timestamp and
interval until the next timestamp.
Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (ts INT64, value UINT32, group_name) where the type of group_name is the same as that in \|segments\|. \|ts\| is the timestamp when the number of open segments changed. \|value\| is the number of open segments. \|group_name\| is the name of a group used for the overlap calculation.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| segments | TableOrSubquery | Table or subquery containing interval data. |
| ts_column | ColumnName | Column containing interval starts (usually `ts`). |
| dur_column | ColumnName | Column containing interval durations (usually `dur`). |
| group_column | ColumnName | Column containing group name for grouping. |

**interval_merge_overlapping**

Merge intervals when they overlap to generate a minimum covering set of
intervals with no overlap. The intervals are closed (contain both endpoints)
and we consider two intervals overlapping
(a) the intervals overlap or
(b) if the end point of one interval is within epsilon of the start point
of the other.
Returns: TableOrSubquery,

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| intervals | TableOrSubquery | Table or subquery containing interval data. |
| epsilon | Expr | Constant expression for a tolerance in testing overlap (usually `0`) |

**interval_merge_overlapping_partitioned**

Merge overlapping intervals within each partition group to generate a minimum
covering set of intervals with no overlap within each partition.

For each partition, this macro merges overlapping intervals into
non-overlapping intervals. The result contains intervals where at least
one input interval is active.

For example, with partition 'A':
Input: (ts=1, dur=10), (ts=5, dur=12)
Output: (ts=1, dur=16)
Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (ts TIMESTAMP, dur DURATION, partitions). \|ts\| is the start of the merged interval. \|dur\| is the duration of the merged interval. \|partitions\| is all of the columns in partition_columns.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| intervals | TableOrSubquery | Table or subquery containing interval data. |
| partition_columns | ColumnNameList | Column name for partition grouping. |

## Package: counters

### counters.intervals

#### Macros

**counter_leading_intervals**

For a given counter timeline (e.g. a single counter track), returns
intervals of time where the counter has the same value. For every run
of identical values, this macro will return a row for the first one,
the last one, and a row merging all other ones. This to to facilitate
construction of counters from delta_values.

Intervals are computed in a "forward-looking" way. That is, if a counter
changes value at some timestamp, it's assumed it *just* reached that
value and it should continue to have that value until the next
value change. The final value is assumed to hold until the very end of
the trace.

For example, suppose we have the following data:

`ts=0, value=10, track_id=1
ts=0, value=10, track_id=2
ts=10, value=10, track_id=1
ts=10, value=20, track_id=2
ts=20, value=30, track_id=1
[end of trace at ts = 40]` Then this macro will generate the following intervals:

`ts=0, dur=10, value=10, track_id=1
ts=10, dur=10, value=10, track_id=1
ts=20, dur=10, value=30, track_id=1
ts=0, dur=10, value=10, track_id=2
ts=10, dur=30, value=20, track_id=2`Returns: TableOrSubquery, Table with the schema: id LONG, As passed in ts TIMESTAMP, As passed in dur DURATION, Difference to the timestamp for the leading row. track_id JOINID(track.id), As passed in value DOUBLE, As passed in next_value DOUBLE, Value for the leading row. delta_value DOUBLE Delta to the *lagging* row - note that this is not the same thing as (next_value - value).

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| counter_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to a "counter-like" table. This table must have the columns "id" and "ts" and "track_id" and "value" corresponding to an id, timestamp, counter track_id and associated counter value. |

## Package: graphs

### graphs.dominator_tree

#### Macros

**graph_dominator_tree**

Given a table containing a directed flow-graph and an entry node, computes
the "dominator tree" for the graph. See \[1\] for an explanation of what a
dominator tree is.

\[1\] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_(graph_theory)>

Example usage on traces containing heap graphs:

\`CREATE PERFETTO VIEW dominator_compatible_heap_graph AS
-- Extract the edges from the heap graph which correspond to references
-- between objects.
SELECT
owner_id AS source_node_id,
owned_id as dest_node_id
FROM heap_graph_reference
JOIN heap_graph_object owner on heap_graph_reference.owner_id = owner.id
WHERE owned_id IS NOT NULL AND owner.reachable
UNION ALL
-- Since a Java heap graph is a "forest" structure, we need to add a dummy
-- "root" node which connects all the roots of the forest into a single
-- connected component.
SELECT
(SELECT max(id) + 1 FROM heap_graph_object) as source_node_id,
id
FROM heap_graph_object
WHERE root_type IS NOT NULL;

SELECT \*
FROM graph_dominator_tree!(
dominator_compatible_heap_graph,
(SELECT max(id) + 1 FROM heap_graph_object)
);\`Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (node_id LONG, dominator_node_id LONG). \|node_id\| is the id of the node from the input graph and \|dominator_node_id\| is the id of the node in the input flow-graph which is the "dominator" of \|node_id\|.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| graph_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to a directed flow-graph on which the dominator tree should be computed. This table must have the columns "source_node_id" and "dest_node_id" corresponding to the two nodes on either end of the edges in the graph. Note: the columns must contain uint32 similar to ids in trace processor tables (i.e. the values should be relatively dense and close to zero). The implementation makes assumptions on this for performance reasons and, if this criteria is not, can lead to enormous amounts of memory being allocated. Note: this means that the graph *must* be a single fully connected component with |
| root_node_id | Expr | The entry node to |

### graphs.partition

#### Macros

**tree_structural_partition_by_group**

Partitions a tree into a forest of trees based on a given grouping key
in a structure-preserving way.

Specifically, for each tree in the output forest, all the nodes in that tree
have the same ancestors and descendants as in the original tree *iff* that
ancestor/descendent belonged to the same group.

Example:
Input

| id | parent_id | group_key |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | NULL | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | NULL | 2 |
| 4 | NULL | 2 |
| 5 | 2 | 1 |
| 6 | NULL | 3 |
| 7 | 4 | 2 |
| 8 | 4 | 1 |

Or as a graph:

`1 (1)
/
2 (1)
/ \
3 (2) 4 (2)
/ \
5 (1) 8 (1)
/ \
6 (3) 7 (2)` Possible output (order of rows is implementation-defined)

| id | parent_id | group_key |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | NULL | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | NULL | 2 |
| 4 | NULL | 2 |
| 5 | 2 | 1 |
| 6 | NULL | 3 |
| 7 | 4 | 2 |
| 8 | 2 | 1 |

Or as a forest:

`1 (1) 3 (2) 4 (2) 6 (3)
| |
2 (1) 7 (2)
/ \
5 (1) 8 (1)`Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (id LONG, parent_id LONG, group_key LONG).

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| tree_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to a tree which should be partitioned. This table must have the columns "id", "parent_id" and "group_key". Note: the columns must contain uint32 similar to ids in trace processor tables (i.e. the values should be relatively dense and close to zero). The implementation makes assumptions on this for performance reasons and, if this criteria is not, can lead to enormous amounts of memory being allocated. |

### graphs.search

#### Macros

**graph_reachable_dfs**

Computes the "reachable" set of nodes in a directed graph from a given set
of starting nodes by performing a depth-first search on the graph. The
returned nodes are structured as a tree with parent-child relationships
corresponding to the order in which nodes were encountered by the DFS.

While this macro can be used directly by end users (hence being public),
it is primarily intended as a lower-level building block upon which higher
level functions/macros in the standard library can be built.

Example usage on traces containing heap graphs:

`-- Compute the reachable nodes from the first heap root.
SELECT *
FROM graph_reachable_dfs!(
(
SELECT
owner_id AS source_node_id,
owned_id as dest_node_id
FROM heap_graph_reference
WHERE owned_id IS NOT NULL
),
(SELECT id FROM heap_graph_object WHERE root_type IS NOT NULL)
);`Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (node_id LONG, parent_node_id LONG). \|node_id\| is the id of the node from the input graph and \|parent_node_id\| is the id of the node which was the first encountered predecessor in a DFS search of the graph.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| graph_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to a directed graph on which the reachability search should be performed. This table must have the columns "source_node_id" and "dest_node_id" corresponding to the two nodes on either end of the edges in the graph. Note: the columns must contain uint32 similar to ids in trace processor tables (i.e. the values should be relatively dense and close to zero). The implementation makes assumptions on this for performance reasons and, if this criteria is not, can lead to enormous amounts of memory being allocated. |
| start_nodes | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to the list of start nodes for the BFS. This table must have a single column "node_id". |

**graph_reachable_bfs**

Computes the "reachable" set of nodes in a directed graph from a given
starting node by performing a breadth-first search on the graph. The returned
nodes are structured as a tree with parent-child relationships corresponding
to the order in which nodes were encountered by the BFS.

While this macro can be used directly by end users (hence being public),
it is primarily intended as a lower-level building block upon which higher
level functions/macros in the standard library can be built.

Example usage on traces containing heap graphs:

`-- Compute the reachable nodes from all heap roots.
SELECT *
FROM graph_reachable_bfs!(
(
SELECT
owner_id AS source_node_id,
owned_id as dest_node_id
FROM heap_graph_reference
WHERE owned_id IS NOT NULL
),
(SELECT id FROM heap_graph_object WHERE root_type IS NOT NULL)
);`Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (node_id LONG, parent_node_id LONG). \|node_id\| is the id of the node from the input graph and \|parent_node_id\| is the id of the node which was the first encountered predecessor in a BFS search of the graph.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| graph_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to a directed graph on which the reachability search should be performed. This table must have the columns "source_node_id" and "dest_node_id" corresponding to the two nodes on either end of the edges in the graph. Note: the columns must contain uint32 similar to ids in trace processor tables (i.e. the values should be relatively dense and close to zero). The implementation makes assumptions on this for performance reasons and, if this criteria is not, can lead to enormous amounts of memory being allocated. |
| start_nodes | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to the list of start nodes for the BFS. This table must have a single column "node_id". |

**graph_next_sibling**

Computes the next sibling node in a directed graph. The next node under a parent node
is determined by on the \|sort_key\|, which should be unique for every node under a parent.
The order of the next sibling is undefined if the \|sort_key\| is not unique.

Example usage:

`-- Compute the next sibling:
SELECT *
FROM graph_next_sibling!(
(
SELECT
id AS node_id,
parent_id AS node_parent_id,
ts AS sort_key
FROM slice
)
);`Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (node_id LONG, next_node_id LONG). \|node_id\| is the id of the node from the input graph and \|next_node_id\| is the id of the node which is its next sibling.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| graph_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to a directed graph for which to find the next sibling. This table must have the columns "node_id", "node_parent_id" and "sort_key". |

**graph_reachable_weight_bounded_dfs**

Computes the "reachable" set of nodes in a directed graph from a set of
starting (root) nodes by performing a depth-first search from each root node on the graph.
The search is bounded by the sum of edge weights on the path and the root node specifies the
max weight (inclusive) allowed before stopping the search.
The returned nodes are structured as a tree with parent-child relationships corresponding
to the order in which nodes were encountered by the DFS. Each row also has the root node from
which where the edge was encountered.

While this macro can be used directly by end users (hence being public),
it is primarily intended as a lower-level building block upon which higher
level functions/macros in the standard library can be built.

Example usage on traces with sched info:

\`-- Compute the reachable nodes from a sched wakeup chain
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE sched.thread_executing_spans;

SELECT \*
FROM
graph_reachable_dfs_bounded
!(
(
SELECT
id AS source_node_id,
COALESCE(parent_id, id) AS dest_node_id,
id - COALESCE(parent_id, id) AS edge_weight
FROM _wakeup_chain
),
(
SELECT
id AS root_node_id,
id - COALESCE(prev_id, id) AS root_target_weight
FROM _wakeup_chain
));\`Returns: TableOrSubquery, The returned table has the schema (root_node_id, node_id LONG, parent_node_id LONG). \|root_node_id\| is the id of the starting node under which this edge was encountered. \|node_id\| is the id of the node from the input graph and \|parent_node_id\| is the id of the node which was the first encountered predecessor in a DFS search of the graph.

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| graph_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to a directed graph on which the reachability search should be performed. This table must have the columns "source_node_id" and "dest_node_id" corresponding to the two nodes on either end of the edges in the graph and an "edge_weight" corresponding to the weight of the edge between the node. Note: the columns must contain uint32 similar to ids in trace processor tables (i.e. the values should be relatively dense and close to zero). The implementation makes assumptions on this for performance reasons and, if this criteria is not, can lead to enormous amounts of memory being allocated. |
| root_table | TableOrSubquery | A table/view/subquery corresponding to start nodes to |
| is_target_weight_floor | Expr | Whether the target_weight is a floor weight or ceiling weight. If it's floor, the search stops right after we exceed the target weight, and we include the node that pushed just passed the target. If ceiling, the search stops right before the target weight and the node that would have pushed us passed the target is not included. |

**cpu_profiling_summary_tree**

TABLE
Table summarising the callstacks captured during any CPU profiling which
occurred during the trace.

Specifically, this table returns a tree containing all the callstacks seen
during the trace with `self_count` equal to the number of samples with that
frame as the leaf and `cumulative_count` equal to the number of samples with
the frame anywhere in the tree.

The data sources supported are the same as the `cpu_profiling_samples` table.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | LONG | The id of the callstack; by callstack we mean a unique set of frames up to the root frame. |
| parent_id | LONG | The id of the parent callstack for this callstack. NULL if this is root. |
| name | STRING | The function name of the frame for this callstack. |
| mapping_name | STRING | The name of the mapping containing the frame. This can be a native binary, library, JAR or APK. |
| source_file | STRING | The name of the file containing the function. |
| line_number | LONG | The line number in the file the function is located at. |
| self_count | LONG | The number of samples with this function as the leaf frame. |
| cumulative_count | LONG | The number of samples with this function appearing anywhere on the callstack. |
